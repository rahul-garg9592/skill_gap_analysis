JavaScript basics include understanding variables (let, const, var), data types (String, Number, Boolean, Object), operators (== vs ===), and control structures (if-else statements). Variables declared with 'let' and 'const' have block scope, whereas 'var' has function scope. JavaScript is dynamically typed and supports type coercion. Hoisting moves declarations to the top of their scope, which can affect variable initialization.
