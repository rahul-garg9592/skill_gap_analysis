Common JavaScript libraries include React (for building UI components), Axios (HTTP requests), Lodash (utility functions), and jQuery (DOM manipulation). React uses components and state to manage complex UIs. Axios simplifies making HTTP requests to APIs. Lodash provides functions like _.debounce and _.cloneDeep to manipulate objects and arrays. jQuery offers simple methods for DOM selection and event handling.
