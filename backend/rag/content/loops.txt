Loops in JavaScript repeat blocks of code. The main loops are 'for', 'while', 'do-while', and 'forEach'. A 'for' loop has a defined start, condition, and increment/decrement. A 'while' loop checks a condition before each iteration. The 'do-while' loop executes at least once because it checks the condition after executing the loop body. The 'forEach' loop iterates over arrays without explicit indexes.
