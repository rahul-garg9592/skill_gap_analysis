JavaScript functions are blocks of reusable code defined using function declarations or expressions. Arrow functions offer a shorter syntax and lexical 'this' binding. JavaScript functions can form closures, capturing variables from the surrounding scope. Functions can be first-class, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions. Callbacks are functions passed into other functions to handle asynchronous operations or to respond to events.
